No you can upgrade to the Forth Phase -- `Phase Kingdom`, with more funny changable and playable.

Many Structures and Technogies are delay to `City phase`, like `Fortress` and `Defense Tower`. And you can guess, `Wonder` cann't built until `Kingdom Phase`.

Delete the `Female Citzen`, and give all factions an old friend -- `Slave`.
